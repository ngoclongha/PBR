# Partitioning Behavioral Retrieval

On Developing
-----------  
  - This demo is written in C# under .Net 4.5 framework
  - The gProAnalyzer tool set provides the user interface for the PBR
  - The prototype of PBR is released as a part of the gProAnalyzer toolset and fully tested with 604 SAP EPC reference models
  - The bug/glitch fixing and updates will be released
  - The final tool is subjected to change without notice
  - The gProAnalyzer toolset includes various of process analysis techniques for process model's verification [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2014.11.003)]
  
Files Including
-----------  
  1. Source code of PBR and execution file of the gProAnalyzer toolset
      * Source code of PBR, which is a part of gProAnalyzer developed by BPM Lab, Inje University, for process modeling analysis [1: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2014.11.003].           
  2. README.md provides:
      * A couple screenshots of the program, 
      * System requirement of the program, and
      * User manual of the program.
  3. Sample SAP models
      * contains 414 SAP EPC reference models   


How to use:
------------
 - Clone the source code using Microsoft Visual Studio
 - Click Debug to interact with the PBR UI.
 - Download the sample dataset "Sound_Acyclic_EPC_414.zip" for testing
 - The experiment section will store the output file to F:/ drive.

System Requirements:
------------
 - Windows OS
 - DotNet Framework 4.5 or higher
