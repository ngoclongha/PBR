# Partitioning Behavioral Retrieval

On Developing
-----------  
  - This demo is written in C# under .Net 4.5 framework
  - The prototype is released as a part of the gProAnalyzer toolset and fully tested with 604 SAP EPC reference models
  - The bug/glitch fixing and updates will be released
  - The final tool is subjected to change without notice
  - The gProAnalyzer toolset includes various of process analysis techniques for process model's verification [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2014.11.003)]
  
Files Including
